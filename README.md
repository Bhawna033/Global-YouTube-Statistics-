2) 🧑‍💼 HR Analytics Dashboard


📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition trends using an interactive Tableau dashboard. The dashboard helps HR professionals and business leaders identify key factors influencing attrition, such as marital status, job role, travel frequency, promotion history, and department.

The insights derived from this analysis can support strategic workforce planning, employee retention initiatives, and policy improvements.

🛠 Tools & Technologies:

Tableau → Data visualization and interactive dashboards

Excel / CSV Dataset → HR dataset used for analysis

Calculated Fields & Filters → For attrition-based KPIs and comparisons

📂 Key Features of Dashboard:

Attrition by Marital Status & Gender

Compares attrition patterns between married, single, and divorced employees across genders.

Attrition Trends by Tenure

Displays attrition levels across years at the company.

Highlights spikes in attrition during the first 5 years.

Attrition by Last Promotion

Correlates attrition with years since last promotion to detect stagnation effects.

Attrition by Department

Identifies departments with the highest attrition (e.g., Research & Development, Sales).

Attrition by Travel History

Shows attrition impact based on travel frequency (e.g., Travel_Rarely employees show highest attrition).

Attrition by Job Role

Attrition by Number of Companies Worked

Analyzes attrition trends based on employees’ past job-hopping history.

📊 Dashboard Preview

🚀 How to Use:

Open the Tableau workbook (.twbx) in Tableau Desktop or view via Tableau Public.

Use filters (Gender, Attrition status) for detailed breakdowns.

Explore visualizations to analyze attrition patterns across demographics, roles, and career paths.

🎯 Insights Gained:

Employees with fewer years at the company (0–5 years) have higher attrition.

Travel_Rarely employees are more prone to attrition compared to frequent travelers.

Research & Development department shows significant attrition numbers.

Lack of promotions over longer periods increases attrition likelihood.

Certain roles such as Sales Executives and Research Scientists are more vulnerable to leaving.
